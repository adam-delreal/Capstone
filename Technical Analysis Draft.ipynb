    "# Financial Modeling: Forecasting Securities\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showcases an attempt to forecast securities using technical indicators (historical stock data) and, in a sense, the potential to earn capital using filings types from the United States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n",

    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem at hand is to evaluate and predict securities using statistical analyses of market activity (e.g. price & volume) and SEC filings.\n",

    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial assumption is that the market moves in trends, therefore engineering short, medium, and long term patterns/trends (moving averages) will be a good indicator and trading strategy.\n",

    "This project is broken down into two main sub-directories, [Stocks](../capstone/stocks) and [SEC](../capstone/sec), starting with the historical stock data. The stock data is sourced from [Quandle](https://www.quandl.com/)'s API. Followed by [Exploratory Data Analysis](../capstone/stocks/Apple_EDA.ipynb) (EDA), where the data is analyzed using graphs and engineered by calculating moving averages, percent changes, and difference in values--more on these concepts later. Upon analyzing and engineering the data, the data is preprocessed and prepared for predictive modeling; [Linear](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_2_Linear_Regression.ipynb) Regression, [Random Forest](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_3_Random_Forest.ipynb) Regression, [Bagging Regression](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_3_Random_Forest.ipynb) on a Random Forest, and Regression using Facebook's [Prophet](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_5_Prophet.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) data-source is their website; where the data was scraped using the BeautifulSoup library. Upon obtaining the data desired, [Exploratory Data Analysis](../capstone/sec/Apple_SEC_EDA.ipynb) is performed as files were grouped and rendered visually. Following the EDA, the data was [prepared](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_Classification_1_Prep.ipynb) to perform [classification modeling](../capstone/stocks/Apple_Model_Classification_3_Random_Forest.ipynb).\n",
